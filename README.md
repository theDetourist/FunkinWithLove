# Funkin' With Löve2D
Current version: 0.0.1a (01/06/22)

Barebones of what could be a recreation of Friday Night Funkin' in Löve2D. Is there a reason for this to exist? You tell me, I'm just here to make this functional.

# Building This

1. First, grab yourself a copy of Löve2D and install it on your computer, the version I'm using to develop this project is [version 11.4](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/11.4).
2. Then, grab a [copy of the project](https://github.com/theDetourist/FunkinWithLove/archive/refs/heads/stable.zip) and drop it somewhere in your computer inside another folder like so.
3. Go to where your **LOVE.exe** executable is (*usually in* **C:\Program Files\LOVE**), make a shortcut of it and drag it inside the folder you created to contain the folder FunkinWithLove.
4. Drag the folder FunkinWithLove into the LOVE shortcut you created and the game should run.

# What's In Store

For now, not much, song conductors have been implemented and in game functionality is barely there. Some important classes have already been made like in Note.lua, Song.lua and others but don't expect to just jump in already and start playing because it didn't go that far yet.

The plans for next versions and what's next can be seen here somewhere, the Issues and Pull Request tabs will be disabled until a playable version comes out so I avoid unnecessary headache and stress.
