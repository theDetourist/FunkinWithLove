# Funkin' With Löve2D
Current version: 0.0.1a (01/06/22)

Barebones of what could be a recreation of Friday Night Funkin' in Löve2D. Is there a reason for this to exist? You tell me, I'm just here to make this functional.

# Building This

1. First, grab yourself a copy of Löve2D and install it on your computer, the version I'm using to develop this project is [version 11.4](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/11.4).
2. Then, grab a [copy of the project](https://github.com/theDetourist/FunkinWithLove/archive/refs/heads/stable.zip) and drop it somewhere in your computer inside another folder like so.
3. Go to where your **LOVE.exe** executable is (*usually in* **C:\Program Files\LOVE**), make a shortcut of it and drag it inside the folder you created to contain the folder FunkinWithLove.
4. Drag the folder FunkinWithLove into the LOVE shortcut you created and the game should run.
